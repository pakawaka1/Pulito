        <p class='text'>Pulito was developed by current and past members of the Bitwise Research and Development Cohort.  As part of working in the Cohort, we learned the importance of teamwork in a software-development environment.  Using our team-building skills, we decided to take this opportunity to challenge ourselves and enter into this yearâ€™s 59 Days of Code Competition on the Smart Cities track.</p>
        <p class='text'>While considering what kind of smart-city app to build, we noticed that Fresno, along with many other cities, lacked mobile-friendly resources to help provide its citizens with local up-to-date information regarding recycling and waste disposal.  Our mobile app, Pulito, seeks to solve this problem by giving users a great easy-to use tool to help find, for example, recycling centers that a scrap aluminum.  Additionally, when a user creates a profile, he or she has access to a visualization of their impact on our environment through a variety of data reports.</p>
        <p class='text'>It is our ethical responsibility to ensure that our environment remains clean for years to come, and Pulito is one resource that can help us achieve this goal.</p>
